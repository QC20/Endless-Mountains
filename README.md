# Endless Mountrains: WebGL Terrain Visualization with Three.js

This repository contains a WebGL-based terrain visualization using Three.js, a popular JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser. The project dynamically generates a terrain landscape with mountains and valleys that evolve over time.

## Features

- **Dynamic Terrain Generation**: The terrain is generated using Perlin noise and sine wave functions to create natural-looking mountains and valleys.
- **Interactive Camera**: The camera perspective is adjustable and follows the terrain movement.
- **Responsive Design**: The visualization adapts to window resizing, maintaining a consistent display.
- **Continuous Animation**: The terrain moves horizontally, creating a looping effect while updating the geometry to simulate movement.

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: A JavaScript library that simplifies the creation and rendering of 3D scenes in WebGL.
- **jQuery**: Used for DOM manipulation and event handling, ensuring smooth interaction with the WebGL canvas.
- **HTML/CSS**: Basic web technologies for structure and styling of the page.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository locally.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Explore the WebGL terrain visualization.
4. Resize the window to see the responsive behavior.
5. Enjoy the continuous animation of the terrain.
